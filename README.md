 🥣 Cereal Analysis Project

This repository presents an end-to-end data analysis project that explores the nutritional content of 80 different cereals. It combines **Python-based data preprocessing** with **interactive Power BI visualizations** to provide meaningful insights into the cereal industry.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Understand and explore the nutritional profile of breakfast cereals.
- Identify patterns based on manufacturer, type (hot/cold), and nutritional values.
- Perform feature engineering and data cleaning using Python.
- Visualize key metrics and comparisons in Power BI for stakeholder presentation.

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Python**: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and KPI insights
- **Data Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Cereal Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/cereal)

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (Python Notebook)

### ✅ Key Steps

- Handled missing values and converted data types appropriately.
- Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis.
- Explored manufacturer-wise and type-wise distribution.
- Studied correlations between features like **calories**, **sugars**, and **rating**.
- Visualized relationships to understand cereal health metrics.

---

### 📌 Key Insights

- 📉 Cereals high in sugar tend to have **lower ratings**.
- 💪 Cereals with **high fiber and protein content** scored better in nutritional ratings.
- 🏢 **General Mills** and **Kellogg's** dominate the cereal landscape in variety.

| **Category**       | **Finding**                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Health Rating       | Positively influenced by fiber and protein; negatively by sugar content     |
| Manufacturer        | General Mills and Kellogg's offer the widest variety                        |
| Type (Hot/Cold)     | Cold cereals are more prevalent and have wider calorie ranges               |
| Fiber vs Sugars     | High fiber, low sugar = higher ratings

## 🧾 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how **data science** and **business intelligence** tools can work together to uncover meaningful insights from real-world datasets. By using **Python** for data preprocessing and **Power BI** for interactive visualizations, we were able to extract key findings related to cereal nutrition, brand competition, and consumer health trends.

The analysis provided:
- A deeper understanding of how ingredients like sugar, fiber, and protein influence health ratings.
- Manufacturer and type-wise comparisons useful for industry benchmarking.
- A decision-support dashboard that enables informed choices for both businesses and consumers.

> Whether you're a data enthusiast, a health-conscious individual, or a strategist in the food industry — this project bridges the gap between raw data and smart decisions.
